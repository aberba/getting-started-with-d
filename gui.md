### [Qte5](https://code.dlang.org/packages/qte5)

Qt binding for D. QtE 5 works great on Win32/64, Linux 32/64 and Mac OS x 64. The main difference is that Qt5 uses a set of pre-defined slots and signals rather than creating them using a MOC or creating them dynamically as dqml. Qt5 has several large applications running on dozens of computers in different companies. If you use dynamic slots and signals from qml in Qt 5, you can fully play all the functionality of Qt5 with dlang. But this is a very big project of the future ...

### [NanoGUI](https://github.com/drug007/nanogui)

D port of nanogui. The port is incomplete - not all widgets are ported, but all ported widgets are fully usable.
