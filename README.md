# Getting Started With D
> This is a work-in-progress reference for new users to get started with using D in their respective area of interest. Please make a pull request if you have something to contribute.

This a reference guide on **Getting Started with D**. Not everything will be written by me since I'm aware there's several existing resources...more of creating an entry point to all those resources (and writing more only when necessary). This is meant to be an up-to-date guide.  I'm looking to cover areas such as:

* Pros of D... general D's strength.
* Leaning resources.
* Development tools available in D Window, Linux, Mac
* Setting up a development environment
* Resources from web/server-side developers
* Resources for game and graphics developers
* Resources for scientific computing
* Resources for desktops development (system, GUIs, ...??)
* Resources for data science (taken separately from general scientific computation)
* Resources for embedded programming
* How and where to get help
* D community platforms (forum, IRC, ???)
* How to contribute to D open source and tools (referencing existing efforts and progress)

> Let me know what else I'm missing

I started this as a [post in the D forums to collect some community feedback](https://forum.dlang.org/post/itxvymhjgmfqdihnswly@forum.dlang.org). If you have something to share or a resource you think I should add, please don't hessitate to **create an issue here** or **post in the forum thread*** reference above. Pull requests are also welcomed, cheers!
