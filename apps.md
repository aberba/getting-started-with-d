D has a high degree of versatility as a language - it does have a sweet spot in high performance desktop and server side applications, but it can nonetheless be used where a scripting language would be the traditional choice: it provides the performance of low-level languages (of the order of C++) with the safety and ease of expression reminiscent of languages like Java and Python.

In fact, nearly everywhere Java is suitable, D could replace it, bringing in more expressive power, better performance and better memory management. Although its current libraries are nowhere near as extensive as the Java libraries, most fundamental bricks are already here, and D has native interfacing to both C and C++, with library solutions for other languages such as Python,R and Lua. You may want to have a look at Phobos and Deimos libraries, as well as third-party libraries to make your own opinion on that matter. A very nice port of Java's SWT library has been created under the name DWT (with older but more complete documentation available at the legacy dsource site). There are also bindings for GTK, and a cross-platform idiomatic D GUI.
